Getting started Typically your application should depend on release versions of storm3java, but you may also use snapshot dependencies for early access to features and fixes, refer to the Snapshot Dependencies section.

Add the relevant dependency to your project:
## Maven
java:
```
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.storm3java/storm3java -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.storm3java</groupId>
    <artifactId>storm3java</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```
